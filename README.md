Box details
===========
For use with imagelibrary.aroq work
From the [dev-metal.com web site](http://www.dev-metal.com/list-downloadable-vagrant-boxes-centos-5-9-6-4-ubuntu-12-13-debian-6-7-7-1-7-2/)

I chose [this box](http://puppet-vagrant-boxes.puppetlabs.com/debian-607-x64-vbox4210.box) which is a Debian Squeeze VM straight from puppet.
